## Overview

This repository provides a robust solution for real-time animal behavior detection and disease identification using cutting-edge deep learning models. It combines the power of YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and MobileNetV2_img_classifier for image classification.

## Features

- **Animal Behavior Detection:** Accurately track and identify animal behaviors in real-time using YOLO.
- **Disease Diagnosis:** Detect and diagnose potential diseases in wildlife through image analysis.
- **Conservation Tool:** An essential tool for wildlife researchers and conservationists to monitor and protect wildlife.
- **Easy Integration:** Well-documented and easy-to-integrate codebase.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install`.

   - **Note:** It is recommended to run this project in a virtual environment named "myenv" using the following command:
    myenv/Script/activate

3. **Configuration:** Replace the config file in the "myenv" folder with your specific configuration.

## Usage

Here's how you can quickly get started:
